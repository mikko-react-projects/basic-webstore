    description: "Table lamp is a table lamp that provides light into all directions. The blown opal glass cover bulb provides a beautiful soft light all around. The lamp’s beautiful support of oak is a fine example of the carpenter’s skills! The whole is finished up by the stylish fabric cord.\n\nThe lamp comes in two sizes: the lower and the higher. The support colours are natural oak and black oak. The table lamp works well alone, but it is at its best together with a friend! It is excellent as a general light or as a light to create atmosphere for many different spaces."

The candle holder is made up of a round wooden u-shaped stem, a brass candle holder and a foot that keeps the candle holder firmly standing up.\n\nThe product’s form had its inspiration from an umbrella handle!\n\nThe candle holder comes in one candle and two candle versions and it is a beautiful eye-catcher both on the dinner table and on the window sill!"
